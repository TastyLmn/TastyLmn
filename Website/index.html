Walking to school, being bitten by a talking crow, spending time with friends, and watching the principal suplex a deer: they are all in a day's work in the extraordinary everyday lives of those in Nichijou.It's a fun anime that brightens your day.

        <p class="p6">If you want to watch a cool character doing his swag moves in a stylish manner with precise technique and add ons like meaning and message then this is the anime you're looking for.
            The story is about a high school boy Sakamoto who is the coolest guy ever and is stylish in every way possible. As it should be all the students especially girls are simps for him. Some guys and especially delinquents often stir up to him to see what's so special about him. Sakamoto will always remain stylish despite being in unfavorable situations most of the time. The episodes are in a linear manner with a good ending.
            The directing, artwork, opening, and ending music were some of the best and was spot on. It got cool characters but barring Sakamoto, the characters were somewhat cliche. The plot is not of utmost importance here, the comedy was not hysterical but was smart. Overall a cool anime.

        <p class="p5">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War is an unconventional romance that is funny and cute with a lot of hilariously exaggerated scenes that add to it's already brilliant premise of two narcissists trying to get the other to confess. It's a great comedy, and a cute romance. And this show's narrator is just a joy to listen to. Backed up by quality animation and voice acting, it's a really good time. I also highly encourage anyone who likes this show to check out the original manga, which delivers on the same clever humor and cute romance, but also tells a more cohesive story instead of being more of a slice of life type of affair

Don't you want to see the hero struggling to kill his enemy? Well not this time. Here, you will see a super-overpowered hero struggling to find a stronger enemy, struggling to feel the thrill and adrenaline of the fights he once felt when he was weak. Was his training to become strong not worth it after all?

        This anime is so random so the plot is unpredictable, in good ways. The animation and the fight scenes are SUPERB! It has the best fight scenes I have ever seen in all of the animes I have ever watched. Go ahead and watch it! It will be worth your time.
